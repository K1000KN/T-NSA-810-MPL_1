Our company is at a stake since our system administrator quit his position...
He left an insecure and partially broken infra which is very critical for us.
Many departments and services are paralysed without the hosted web platform.
We also fear a cyber-attack in the weeks to come.
Please take ownership of the infra, and fix it as soon as possible!
